# DonirajITi web application for donations

DonirajITi is a web application whose vision is to connect donors and people who need donations. 

To use the platform, it is necessary for the user to have an active internet connection and create an account profile. Registration and login of the user is done by proper validation of their data. DonirajITi provides users with a clear overview of all previous posts and easy navigation through them. It is also possible to view each post individually, along with the name of the user who posted it, location, category and contact information. Each user will be able to see their posts on their profile and will be offered the option to modify the content or delete it. Users will be able to use the system to filter posts according to different attributes (municipality and/or category) or use the search box. They will also be offered the option to share the posts on social networks.

The DonirajITi web application is built on the XAMMP server, using MariaDB as a database management system. The code is written in PHP coding language with HTML, CSS and Bootstrap.
